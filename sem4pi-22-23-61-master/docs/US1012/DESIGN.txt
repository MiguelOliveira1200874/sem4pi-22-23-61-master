To design the class scheduling feature, we can utilize the standard layered architecture of the base application. This use case shares similarities with the "RegisterDishType" use case.

Domain Class: ClassSchedule
Controller: ScheduleClassController
Repository: ClassScheduleRepository

The ClassSchedule class will represent the domain entity for a scheduled class, containing attributes such as class ID, title, start time, end time, start date, end date, day of the week, and the associated teacher.

The ScheduleClassController will handle the business logic for scheduling classes. It will interact with the ClassScheduleRepository to persist and retrieve class schedule data.

Following the layered architecture, the presentation layer (e.g., console or GUI) will interact with the ScheduleClassController to collect input from the user and display relevant information.
